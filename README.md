# June-Sherin
I want to proudly tell everyone about coming out. When I was 11 years old, I realized that I was not a boy; I was a girl. I struggled for 20 years because of my family and society. Now, at 34, I feel that if I don't come out, maybe I will harm myself... My name was Shab, but now I have changed it to "June Sherin." Love to all.
